Metabolic flux estimation
-------------------------

`influx_si` can be used for metabolic flux estimation based on labeling data from MS and/or NMR measurements. `influx_s` is used for stationary labeling and `influx_i` for instationary one (hence the '_s' and '_i' in the names). Tha name `influx_si` is used as common for both tools.

The input for `influx_si` in one or several FTBL files, each describing a given labeling experiment and options to use during estimation. In addition, for `influx_i` a file with time course data has to be provided for each FTBL file.

The output is a zip archive with files generated by `influx_si`. Among the most important is file ending with `_res.kvh` which contains the main information about estimated parameters, their statistics and so on.
If, in your FTBL file, you have requested ploting information, it can be found in respective .pdf file.
